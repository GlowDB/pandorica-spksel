# Philips MCM704D remote control codes
#
# Notes: This is a modal remote, with many keys disabled or set to different
# keycodes after the CD/USB/Tuner/iPod/Aux buttons are pressed.
#
# The modal set of keys are labeled -- e.g. the preset button "Cd1" is
# distinct from "Tuner1".
#
# The most unusual part is that in USB mode, the remote switches to an
# entirely different set of codes (RC6 protocol) -- perhaps USB was a feature
# tacked on to the receiver in a later revision of the model.
#
# Thus, irrecord can't handle both sets of commands in a single session, and
# we set them up as two different remotes. This caused much frustration and
# messages like
#
#   "Something went wrong. Please try again. (9 retries left)"
#
# while trying to learn the different codes.
